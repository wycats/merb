= merb-cache

A plugin for the Merb framework that provides caching

Currently supported methods:

- page caching:
- action caching
- fragment caching
- object caching

Implemented cache stores:

- memory
- memcache
- file
- database (sequel, datamapper, activerecord)

== Quick intro
  cache_fragment is helpful to put chunks of data in cache without interferring with dynamic content.

  cache_action puts the whole action in cache but if you use before filters to restrict access,
  you can still protect your content.

  cache_page is cache_action with file store (using .html extension in a separate directory).
  With page caching you output .html files (in public/cache/ by default) so you can then tell your proxy/webserver
  to serve these files directly thus bypassing the framework completely.

== Quick API

=== Merb::Controller class methods
  cache_action(action, expiration)
  cache_actions(action, [action, expiration], ...)
  cache_page(action, expiration)
  cache_pages(action, [action, expiration], ...)

=== Merb::Controller instance methods
  expire_page(key)
  cached_page?(key)
  expire_all_pages()

  expire_action(key)
  cached_action?(key)

  cached?(key)
  cache_get(key)
  cache_set(key, data, expiration)
  expire(key)
  expire_all()

=== Inside your template
  cache(key, expiration) do ... end

  # expiration is given in minutes

  # key can be a string or a hash
  # possible keys when it's a hash:
  # :key (full key)
  # :params (array of params to be added to the key)
  # :action, :controller
  # :match (true or partial key)

  # Don't forget to look at the specs !!

== Specs
  $ rake specs:<cache_store>
  example:
  $ rake specs:memory
  $ rake specs:file
  or just:
  $ cd spec
  $ STORE=<cache_store> spec merb-cache_spec.rb
  # cache_store can be: memory, memcache, file, sequel, datamapper, activerecord

== Sample configuration

  Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_cache] = {
    :cache_html_directory => Merb.dir_for(:public) / "cache",

    #:store => "database",
    #:table_name => "merb_cache",

    #:disable_cache => "development", # disable merb-cache in development
    #:disable_cache => "all", # disable merb-cache in all environments

    :store => "file",
    :cache_directory => Merb.root_path("tmp/cache"),

    #:store => "memcache",
    #:host => "127.0.0.1:11211",
    #:namespace => "merb_cache",

    #:store => "memory",
    # store could be: file, memcache, memory, database, dummy, ...
  }


== Quick Example

==== controller part
  class Users < Merb::Controller
    cache_page :action_name
    # this will cache the action in public/cache/something.html
    # this cache entry will never expire (no expiration provided)
    # for permanent caching you could set your lighty/nginx so as to handle
    # the .html file directly
    # for multiple page caching:
    # cache_pages :action_name, [:another_action, 5], :some_action

    cache_action :another_action, 10
    # this will cache the action using the cache store
    # this cache entry will expire in 10 minutes
    # for multiple action caching:
    # cache_actions :action_name, [:another_action, 5], :some_action

    def list
      unless @users = cache_get("active_users")
        @users = User.all(:active => true)
        cache_set("active_users", @users)
        # object caching can be used to avoid pulling huge amounts of data
        # from the database.
        # you could have calle cache_set with an expiration time as well:
        # cache_set("active_users", @users, 10)
      end
      render
    end

    def some_action_that_invalidates_cache
      expire_page(:action_name)
      expire_action(:another_action)
      render
    end

    def delete
      expire("active_users")
      render
    end

    def archives
      @archives = User.archives unless cached?("users_archives")
      render
    end

    def index
      render
    end
  end


====views/users/index.html.erb
  # this entry will expire in 10 minutes
  <%- cache "users_index", 10 do %>
   <div>some big template</div>
  <% end -%>

====views/users/archive.html.erb
  <%- cache "users_archives" do %>
   <div>some big template</div>
  <% end -%>
