== 1.0.13 "The weekend has landed" 2009-10-30

* [merb_datamapper] Support for dm-0.10.x (identity map wrapping is now perforemd at the rack level)
* [merb-core] Fix run_later to work on servers other than just 'merb' (Thin or Phusion Passenger for example)
* [merb-gen] Don't add resource route to config/routes.rb when using -p or -d with merb-gen resource
* [merb-gen] Explain how to load dependencies in (very) flat apps
* [merb] Fixed failing rake install due to missing merb-more
* [merb] rake uninstall now uninstalls everything that got rake install'ed
* [merb-core] Allow testing without webrat
* [merb-haml] Fixed compilation of sass files
* [merb-helpers] Select the correct field in bound select tags

* [merb-core] -i and --irb-console take precedence over config in init.rb.

  This change allows you to have default adapter set
  in the init.rb and still if you want to run Merb in
  IRB you can do it. Currently you can't because setting
  adapter in init.rb override the config value from ARGV
  parsing.

* [merb-helpers] Generate valid html id attributes

  This patch changes any occurrence of '[' or ']' in id attributes to '_'.
  The brackets are not valid characters in an HTML id attribute value.

* [merb-core] Fix potential timing attack on cookie sessions

  This patch fixes a potential timing attack on the HMAC authentication
  used to verify cookie session contents by ensuring a constant time
  algorithm is used to compare the hashes.  For more information see:

  http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/

* [merb-auth-slice-password] Use proper config value

  Without this change, the default password strategy
  is always activated because the wrong config key is
  used.

* [merb-gen] Fixing generated thor task to work with RubyGems 1.3.5.

  Setting thor dependency to "~> 0.9.9", as newer versions will break
  the default merb-gen app bundling tasks

* [merb-core] Fixed multipart specs (including spec10)

  The previous version of the spec was wrong in expecting that

    file_params[:tempfile].should be_a_kind_of(File)

  This spec only passed because of a now resolved bug in older versions of rspec.
  The correct spec for the tempfile param now reads:

    file_params[:tempfile].should be_a_kind_of(Tempfile)

* To run merb's specsuite (rake spec or rake specs:oneoh) you will either need webrat-0.3.1 or webrat-0.4.0
  installed. webrat-0.4 is recommended for use in your app's specs, using newer versions of webrat may be
  possible but is not explicitly supported.
